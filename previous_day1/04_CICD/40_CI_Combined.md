# Summary

We now have

* Go app in the `training` project with CI tests
* Docker image build in the `docker-fpm` project

What's missing?

* A new pipeline stage for building packages
* Keep it simple stupid with FPM

# Lab ~~~SECTION:MAJOR~~~.~~~SECTION:MINOR~~~: Add RPM package stage to the Go app

* Objective:
 * Add `pkg-rpm` stage and job to Go app in the `training` project
* Steps:
 * Open `Project > Branches` and the `feature/go-app` branch
 * Open the Web IDE and edit `.gitlab-ci.yml`
 * Modify the `stages` array and add `package` after `build`
 * Add a new job `pkg-rpm`

Note that artifacts from all previous stages are passed by default.

    pkg-rpm:
      stage: package
      image: $CI_REGISTRY/devops/docker-fpm/fpm
      script:
        - fpm -s dir -t rpm -n go-app go-app
        - rpm -qpl *.rpm
      artifacts:
        paths:
          - "*.rpm"
