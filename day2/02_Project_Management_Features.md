# Issues

Use issues to collaborate on ideas, solve problems, and plan work. Share and discuss proposals with your team and with outside collaborators.

Use Cases:
* Discuss the implementation of an idea
* Track tasks and work status
* Accept feature proposals, questions, support requests, or bug reports
* Elaborate on code implementations

## Creating issues
When you create a new issue, you are prompted to fill in the data and fields of the issue.

### Issue Actions
Issues can be either open or closed. It is also possible to reopen issues.
A reopened issue is no different from any other open issue.

### Marking as To-Do
Every user has a global To-Do list.
If an issue is:
Already on your To-Do List: The button is labeled Mark as done. Click the button to remove the issue from your To-Do List.
Not on your To-Do List: The button is labeled Add a to do. Click the button to add the issue to your To-Do List.

### Assignee
An issue can be assigned to any number of people and the assignee can be changed at any point.
Multiple assigned users are a premium feature.

If an issue is assigned to you, it will appear on your assigned issue list.
If a user is not member of that project, it can only be assigned to them if they created the issue themselves.

### Due Date
When you work on a tight schedule, it’s important to have a way to set a deadline for implementations and for solving problems.
Due dates can be changed as many times as needed.

### Weight
Weight assignments are a premium feature.
Larger values indicate that more effort is required to complete the issue.

### Confidentiality
You can set an issue to be confidential.
Unauthorized users cannot access the issue, and it is not listed in the project’s issue boards nor list for them.
This is useful to hide security issues from the general public, while still allowing the engineers to keep their workflows.

### Locking issues
You can prevent further discussions in issues, if something gets too heated or it is being put on hold.

### Participants
All the users involved in that issue.
Either they participated in the thread, or were mentioned in the description or threads.

## Managing Issues

### Epics
Epics are a premium feature.
An epic is a type of issue meant to group smaller issues that share a theme.
They can have their own roadmap and function similar to milestones.
